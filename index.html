            We propose a novel plan-then-populate framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL) for scalable, high-quality long video generation. Experiments on standard benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms existing video generation models in quality and stability.

Our method operates on two planning levels: (1) Micro Plans, which predict a sequence of future frames within each segment to mitigate local error accumulation, and (2) a Macro Plan, formed as an Autoregressive Chain of Micro Plans, where the planning frames of the first segment autoregressively generate the planning frames of subsequent segments, ensuring long-horizon temporal consistency.</p>

                    A cinematic scene from a classic western movie, featuring a rugged man riding a powerful horse through the vast Gobi Desert at sunset. The man, dressed in a dusty cowboy hat and a worn leather jacket, reins tightly on the horse's neck as he gallops across the golden sands. The sun sets dramatically behind them, casting long shadows and warm hues across the landscape. The background is filled with rolling dunes and sparse, rocky outcrops, emphasizing the harsh beauty of the desert. A dynamic wide shot from a low angle, capturing both the man and the expansive desert vista.

              While Self Forcing addresses exposure bias and we observe no error accumulation within the video length the model is 
              trained on (5 seconds), we still observe quality degradation when extrapolating beyond its training horizon. Below we 
              show 30-second videos generated via sliding window extrapolation.
